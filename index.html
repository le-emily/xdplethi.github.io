      <h2>LESS Guide</h2>
      <h3>What is LESS?</h3>
      <p>LESS is a JavaScript library with similar syntax to CSS format that the browser can read. LESS is very convenient when it's larned after CSS because all LESS is CSS code but not all CSS is LESS code. This is great because your existing CSS is already valid LESS code—meaning there is a very small learning curve! And very similar to programming languages, you will recognize some terminologies I will go over in this guide.
      </p>

      <p>For your reference, click <a href="http://lesscss.org/">here</a> for orginal documentation</p>


      <h3>How to Use LESS?</h3>
      Various mechanisms that will be addressed are variables, mixins, namespace and operationss and functions. The LESS compiling converts all LESS code into CSS instantly in the browser with less.js, using the lessc compiler via the command-line, or a third party app. However, I will only be going over some important uses with LESS.
      <h4>Variables</h4>
      <p>LESS variables start with "@" and are written like "@green". So, when you want to set a variable you'd set a constant variable named @green, add a green color and use it in your stylesheet that you can access throughout your program. No “Find and replace” when you can just change one line! See the @green example below:</p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        @main_color: green;
        h2 {
          color: @main_color;
        }
      </pre>

    <!--  -->
      <h4>Mixins</h4>
      <p>Mixins share some similarities to functions in programming languages. In Less, they’re used to group CSS code in reusable classes. They allow you to embed all the properties of a class into another class by including the class name as one of its properties. Here's an example:

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        #about_me {
        color: blue;
        .rounded-borders;
        }

        .rounded-borders {
        border-radius: 5px;
        padding-right: 10px;
        padding-left: 10px;
      }</pre>

      <p>As you can see above, the round-borders class is embedded in the about_me class as a property.</p>

      <p>LESS has an ability to do "guarded mixins." These are mixins that only take affect when a certain condition/expression is true. As an example, say you want to set a background color based on the current text color in a module. You don't want dark text on a dark background nor light text on a light background--it would give your readers a headache! If the text color is "light" you'll probably want a dark background. If it's "dark" you'll want a light background. So you have a single mixin split into two parts with these guards that ensure that only one of them takes effect depending on the condition.</p>

       <!-- Example of guard mixin -->
      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        .background-color (@text-color) when (lightness(@text-color) >= 50%) {
          background: black;
        }
        .background-color (@text-color) when (lightness(@text-color) < 50%) {
          background: white; }
      </pre>

      <p>Take notice of how the word, when, was used. This word tells you that a guard is going to be in place. What if we run the following code?</p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        .some_class1 {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        .background-color("light");
        }

        .some_class2 {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          .background-color("light");
        }
      </pre>

      <p>It would translate into this:</p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        .some_class1 {
        background-color: black;
        color: #ddd;
        }
        .some_class2 {
        background-color: white;
        color: #555;
        }
      </pre>

      <p>As you can see, it's very useful when you want some property of a class to change based upon some conditional rule(s).</p>

    <h4>Nesting</h4>
    <p>In CSS, we write out every rule set separately like so:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
      #main_nav {}
      #main_nav ul {}
      #main_nav ul li {}
      #main_nav ul li a {}
    </pre>
    <p>As you can see, this might get rather repetitive. LESS allows us to nest rules within rules, and the hierarchy is rather easy to physically visualize. The above example in LESS can be written as:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        #main_nav {
          ul {
            li {
              a {}
            }
          }
    </pre>

    <p>Nesting is great because it keeps your code organized and you can clearly see what is visually related and what is not.</p>

    <h4>Namespace</h4>
    <p>Namespace is used to group variables. This is very useful if you want to avoid naming clashes</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
      //We declare the namespace here with two mixins--one to set the width and height of the square and the other to set the color.
      #namespace{
        .square(@parameter){
          width: @parameter;
          height: @parameter;
        }
        .color(@color){
          color: @color;
        }
      }

      .box{
      //We use the namespace to set dimension (12px sets both the width and height to 12 x 12 px) and color for the box.
        #namespace > .square(12px);
        #namespace .color(#ff0000);
      }
    </pre>

    <p>The LESS namespace code above is equivalent and would compile to:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
      .box {
        width: 12px;
        height: 12px;
        color: #ff0000;
      }
    </pre>

    <p>Here's an example of a nested namespace.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
      #out{
        #namespace{
          .square(@parameter){
            width: @parameter;
            height: @parameter;
          }
        }
      }

      .box{
        #out > #namespace > .square(12px);
      }
    </pre>

    <p>Mixins within a namespace can also be separated.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
      #out{
        #namespace{
          .square(@parameter){
            width: @parameter;
          }
          .square(@parameter){
            height: @parameter;
          }
        }
      }

      .box{
        #out > #namespace > .square(12px);
      }
</pre>

    <h4>Operations and Functions</h4>
    <p>Operations and functions, which let you manipulate values using mathematical operationss that you may be very familiar with! Lets take a look at an example:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
      @outerWidth: 500px;
      @borderWidth: 20px;
      @padding: 10px;

      #container {
        width: @outerWidth - (@borderWidth + @padding) * 2;
        border: @borderWidth solid black;
        padding: @padding;
      }
    </pre>

    <p>The example above uses variables to compute the container's width for border width and padding.</p>

  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>LESS is very advantageous to some programmers as you can reuse many of the redundant parts of the code--who wouldn't want to save extra typing? Though there are a lot of pros, this guide is not to say that LESS is better than other styling. I think that depends on what you feel most comfortable with. But I do hope that this guide has exposed you to some LESS attributes that you confused with previously.</p>
